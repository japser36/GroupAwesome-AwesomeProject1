## 2 Discussion of process

Some of the problems I had while trying to make this for java is that the question makes me print things from the consume and the job, which means I can't use interfaces.

Some problems that I had with C are it is not an OOP, which is a pain. The different pointers' different variations made it challenging to determine which to use or where a particular variable is. Memory on the stack was a colossal pain where object overrides each other due to a slower thread or a new object replaced the stack as it was "no longer in use."

While troubleshooting, the C error messages are non-informative in saying something went wrong without stating the cause of the issue. There were instances of random error being thrown, i.e., in the main method with no threads on a for a loop. C prompted that this increment causes a segfault when it doesn't and shouldn't.

Also, the documentation is not up to standard, making it extremely difficult to find how to use anything or how it interacts with other methods, actions, etc. Resulting in the need for brute-forcing through lists of functions to find the function that matched my use case.
