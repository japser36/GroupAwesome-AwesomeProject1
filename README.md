# GroupAwesome-AwesomeProject1

## 1. Accomplished Items
1. Separation of the closh function into a separate execution function for code simplicity
2. Established a time out handler via the alarm() function
3. A wait-status to ensure that the parent process waits till all children have executed (Differentiating seq. and parallel processing)
4. Fixed issue with regards to IDE errors


Execution function (exe): It simplifies the code by placing the execvp command outside of the while loop that handles closh conditions. In the exe method, pid is queried and printed. In case of failure, an error message is printed by the method prior to exiting.

While loop for printing: Handles the task of printing user-specified text (in an example, the hostname is printed in below sample outputs)â€”checks for process validity by checking if pid is 0. If true, continues to the exe function as mentioned above. The parallel and sequential processing are handled within the method shown inline 108-117 in closh.c.

## 2. Sample Output
### 2.1 Sample output for sequential output: 
```
closh> hostname
count> 8
  [p]arallel or [s]equential> s
timeout> 5

Current pid =7220
Win32
Current pid =7221
Win32
Current pid =7222
Win32
Current pid =7223
Win32
Current pid =7224
Win32
Current pid =7225

```

### 2.2 Sample output for parallel processing: 
```
closh> hostname
  count> 3
    [p]arallel or [s]equential> p
  timeout> 8
  
Current pid =7237
Current pid =7236

## 3. Instructions to Run Program
1. Clone repo
2. Navigate inside `GroupAwesome-AwesomeProject1` directory
3. Compile closh.c using the following command `gcc closh.c -o closh`
4. Run closh using the following command `./closh`
5. Use the sleephello.sh command by entering the following command `./sleephello.sh`
6. Enter your desired count, parallel or sequential execution and timeout
